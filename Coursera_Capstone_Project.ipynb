    "After learning about data science and how it can be used to solve real life problems, I’ve started my own company, DataMiners Inc. DataMiners has subscribed to various data sources all over the world. Using this data along with other packages like FourSquare which provides location data, our company can help clients solve various business problems. One of the common use of our expertise is to help potential business owners who want to know the optimum location to start a new business in a given geographical area like a city or a neighborhood.\n",
    "Our latest client is a father son team who would like to open an Indian restaurant in the Toronto area. They have come to us to help them with Toronto Neighborhoods, the existing restaurant scene in the city, and some suggestions for best locations for their new restaurant. They would like the restaurant to be in a place where there is sizable asian population, but it doesn’t currently have an Indian restaurant. \n"
